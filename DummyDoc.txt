Jacob Deffendall:
	This summer, I did a lot of wood work. My parents wanted a lot of furniture made, so I ended up
doing that for most of my summer. First, I made two outdoor chairs for our back porch. Next I made a little
table to put between the chairs. Next, I made three wooden end tables. I ended up selling two of them, and
the third I gave to my parents. Next, I made a bunk bed for my younger siblings, which ended up being very
difficult. Finally, I made a bench that my parents wanted to go on our front porch. So while I couldn't get
a job, I was able to make some money and spend my time doing some useful things.

	Over the summer, I worked on a few software development projects. I made a mobile app for ordering from a 
small restaurant and a website to help employees work from home. I also spent a lot of time building custom toy boxes.
I enjoyed buying furniture and decorations for my new apartment which I moved into recently. Any extra time I had left
I spent playing Rocket League and Counter-Strike.
