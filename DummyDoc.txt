Jacob Deffendall:
	This summer, I did a lot of wood work. My parents wanted a lot of furniture made, so I ended up
doing that for most of my summer. First, I made two outdoor chairs for our back porch. Next I made a little
table to put between the chairs. Next, I made three wooden end tables. I ended up selling two of them, and
the third I gave to my parents. Next, I made a bunk bed for my younger siblings, which ended up being very
difficult. Finally, I made a bench that my parents wanted to go on our front porch. So while I couldn't get
a job, I was able to make some money and spend my time doing some useful things.

Evan Knapke:
	This summer, I worked at a landscaping job every day. I worked 6 days every week putting doing various 
landscaping duties. I worked at a clients house that he was building, putting in his plants and stone features. 
Most days I was putting in stone paths or boulders for the client. Some days I would be planting massive trees,
some days I would be planting tiny ground cover. Sadly, I did not have much time to work on my software projects 
this summer and I really slacked on that. But overall, I enjoyed working and had a good summer.
